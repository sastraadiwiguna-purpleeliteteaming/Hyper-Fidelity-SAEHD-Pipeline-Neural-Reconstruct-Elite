⚖️ LEGAL & ETHICAL DISCLAIMER
Project: Neural Reconstruction & Deepfake AI Pipeline
Status: STRICTLY_FOR_RESEARCH_AND_ACADEMIC_PURPOSES Version: 1.0.0-DETERMINISTIC

1. 🚨 ATTENTION: LEGAL COMPLIANCE MANDATE
This software and documentation are provided as a technical framework for Neural Reconstruction Analysis. Any use of this technology to create, distribute, or promote non-consensual content (NCII - Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery) or to commit fraud is a direct violation of global laws and the intended purpose of this repository.

Regional Legal Frameworks:
INDONESIA: Under Law No. 11/2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (UU ITE) Articles 27-35, the creation or distribution of defamatory or non-consensual content is punishable by up to 6 years of imprisonment and/or heavy fines.

GLOBAL (USA/EU/AU): Violation of the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act or the EU AI Act regarding transparency and consent can lead to severe federal prosecution and civil litigation.

2. 🛡️ PURPLE TEAMING & RED TEAMING PROTOCOL
This repository is an instrument of PURPLE_ELITE_TEAMING. It is designed to empower security professionals to:

Analyze Vulnerabilities: Test the bypass capabilities of biometric facial recognition systems (Liveness Detection).

Reverse Engineering: Understand the artifact patterns left by GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to build better AI Detectors.

Digital Forensics: Identify hardware fingerprints and neural signatures in synthetic media.

ABSOLUTE RULE: Users are strictly prohibited from using this pipeline on datasets involving individuals who have not provided explicit, written, and verifiable consent.

3. ⚠️ TECHNICAL RISK & HARDWARE LIABILITY
Thermal Load: The training process (SAEHD/LIAE) utilizes 100% of GPU resources for extended periods. The author is not responsible for hardware failure, thermal throttling, or permanent damage to NVIDIA RTX/A100/H100 series GPUs resulting from improper cooling or overclocking.

Deterministic Integrity: While the pipeline is optimized for 100% accuracy, results may vary based on dataset quality. There is no guarantee of "perfect" realism if the input data deviates from the specified technical requirements.

4. 🕵️ OPSEC & ANONYMITY NOTICE
This pipeline includes features for Hardware Fingerprint Mitigation (Metadata Wiping). These tools are provided solely to demonstrate how digital forensic trails can be obfuscated.

Warning: Obfuscating metadata for the purpose of concealing a crime is a separate criminal offense in many jurisdictions.

Traceability: Modern AI detection algorithms are increasingly capable of detecting "Neural Signatures" that bypass standard metadata scrubbing. Do not assume 100% invisibility.

5. 🚫 NO WARRANTY & NO HOLDING BACK
This material is provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied. The author, SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA, and the associated ELITE_TEAMING units shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use this software.

By accessing, cloning, or running the code in this repository, you hereby agree to:

Assume 100% Responsibility for your actions.

Indemnify the Author from any legal repercussions or civil suits.

Uphold the Ethics of a High-Level Cybersecurity Researcher.

📑 6. ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR USERS
Transparency: If synthetic media is generated for research, it must be clearly watermarked or labeled as "AI Generated."

Integrity: Use your own likeness (Source = Self) for all testing and calibration.

Contribution: Focus your findings on improving Deepfake detection mechanisms (Blue Teaming).
